# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe game using Minimax Algorithm


This repo contains all the necessary files required to run the game.
The main code is contained in the main.py file.

Just download all the files at once. Put all of them in the same folder.
Compile all of them and finally run the main.py button.

All the rules of the game will be displayed each time you click the run button.

Note:- For any suggestions related to improving the program, you can contact me directly or leave the comments here itself. I would be happier to optimize the program to work better.
